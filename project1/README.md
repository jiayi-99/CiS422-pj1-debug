Overview
Hikers, runners, and cyclists often record their activites using a phone, fitness watch, or dedicated GPS device. They may upload data from their devices to a system like Strava, MapMyRun, or RideWithGPS, which typically provide analysis, map display, and optional social media sharing.

Existing services like Strava provide a variety of analyses and record keeping, but they typically do not provide a fully automated way to extract turn-by-turn directions from a recorded activity. For hikers and runners and some cyclists who travel off-road, this might be very difficult … there may be no suita-ble database from which to extract suitable cues. For road cyclists, however, it should be possible to extract turn-by-turn directions (a “cue sheet”) from a recording.
